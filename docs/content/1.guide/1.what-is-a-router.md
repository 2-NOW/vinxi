# What is a Router?

Routers are the core primitive of Vinxi. 

A router is a specification for how a group of routes should be handled. Lets take a look at the different parts of a router.

## Common Options

### `name`

::list

- Each router has a name. 

- Used to reference the router by other routers. For example, to access the manifest of a different router, use `import.meta.env.MANIFEST['<name>']`.

- The name of the router that the code is currently executing in is available as `import.meta.env.ROUTER_NAME`.
::

### `base`

::list

- The base path of the router. 
- The path that the router will be mounted at. For example, if the base is `"/foo"`, then the router will be mounted at `"/foo"` and will respond to requests matching `"/foo/**/*"`. 
- The base path is available as `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
::

### `mode`

::list
- The mode of the router.
- Determines how the other parts of the router are interpreted.
- The mode is available as `import.meta.env.ROUTER_MODE`.
::

### `routes`

::list
- The mode of the router.
- Determines how the other parts of the router are interpreted.
- The mode is available as `import.meta.env.ROUTER_MODE`.
::

### `target`

::list
- Target platform for the router.
- Available targets are: `"browser"`, `"server"`
::

### `plugins`
::list
::

### `outDir`

::list
- The output directory for the router.
::

> Vinxi supports a few router modes out of the box: `"static"`, `"handler"`, `"build"`, `"spa"`. New modes can be added by you too. Lets see how each mode is different?

## `mode: "static"`

::list
- A simple static router that serves files from the `fs.dir` directory at the `base` path.
- Its useful for serving static assets like images, fonts, etc.
- Usually every app has one of these.
- No compilation is done for this router.
::
```ts
import { createApp } from "vinxi";

export default createApp({
  routers: [
    name: "public",
    base: "/",
    mode: "static",
    fs: {
      dir: "./public",
    },
  ]
});
```

### `dir`


## `mode: "handler"`

::list
- A router typically targetting the server. 
- The router responds to requests matching the `base` path with the event handler exported from the `handler` file.
- It can also include a file system router to map files to sub routes
::
```ts
import { createApp } from "vinxi";

export default createApp({
  routers: [
    name: "ssr",
    base: "/",
    mode: "handler",
    handler: "./ssr-handler.ts",
    fs: {
      dir: "./routes",
    },
    compile: {
      target: "server"
    }
  ]
});
```

### `handler`

::list
- The mode of the router.
- Determines how the other parts of the router are interpreted.
- The mode is available as `import.meta.env.ROUTER_MODE`.
::

### `middleware`

::list
- The mode of the router.
- Determines how the other parts of the router are interpreted.
- The mode is available as `import.meta.env.ROUTER_MODE`.
::

## mode: `"build"`

::list
- A build router serves the compiled handler and subroutes as static assets.
- A common use case is to build the client-side of a SSR app.
- The chunks and entry-points exposed by a build router can be addressed using the manifest by other routers.
- Since its mostly built assets, its good to use a `base` that the user will not visit easily., eg. `"/_build"`
- Supports complete HMR on the client
::

```ts
import { createApp } from "vinxi";

export default createApp({
  routers: [
    name: "client",
    base: "/_build",
    mode: "build",
    handler: "./client-handler.ts",
    fs: {
      dir: "./routes",
    },
    compile: {
      target: "server"
    }
  ]
});
```

::list
- Use the handler from this router as the `src` to render a script tag in the SSR response. 
::



```ts
const clientManifest = import.meta.env.MANIFEST["client"];
const scriptSrc = clientManifest.inputs[clientManifest.handler];
const scriptTag = `<script src="${scriptSrc}"></script>`;
```

### `handler`

::list
- The mode of the router.
- Determines how the other parts of the router are interpreted.
- The mode is available as `import.meta.env.ROUTER_MODE`.
::


## mode: `"spa"`

### `handler`

::list
- The mode of the router.
- Determines how the other parts of the router are interpreted.
- The mode is available as `import.meta.env.ROUTER_MODE`.
