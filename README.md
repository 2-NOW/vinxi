### A suite of libraries for making game development with Three.js and React not only awesome, but "so good, it would feel wrong to use anything else." â€“ [hmans](https://github.com/sponsors/hmans)

Building games with React and Three.js is already pretty cool, but a lot of tooling you need to make those games _really nice_ is still missing. This project tries to fill some of these gaps by providing a collection of libraries for various aspects of game development, from **GPU-driven particle systems and VFX**, to **game UI**, **editor tooling**, **camera rigs**, **audio**, **multi-device input**, and more.

> **Note**
> While this suite of libraries targets building games with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React-Three-Fiber], some of them can also be used outside of React, just like some others are not specific to Three.js or React-Three-Fiber. But building games with React is where our hearts are at, which is why you will find most example code in this document to be written in React. ðŸ˜Ž
